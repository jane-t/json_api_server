# json_api_server
## Introduction
Simple Rest Sensor with attribute template

This home assistant component is designed to allow easy access via a REST sensor where you need to apply a complex process to set the attributes data.
In my case the Readeck bookmark system allows list of bookmarks, but does no label the top level array in the json so it is not possible to select it to set an attribute.

This component can be used with a jinja script to extract what is needed into a single sensor.
